### Update Frequency

This is the public Git repository for Accidental Woman. Presently it is updated when a new public version of the game is ready, however this may change in the future. It isn't possible to provide the complete source for the game, so at this time building entirely from this repository is impossible anyway.

### Building From The Public Repository

In order to build from this repository, you will need TweeGo, which is available on the motoslave website. Instructions on using it are also available there. I won't be providing support for creating your own build, there simply isn't time.

1. Decompile the latest html file that you have access to using TweeGo. *This will provide files and code that can't be distributed freely*
1. Download the repository, and flatten the folder structure so that files are arranged in the same way as the ones from the decompiled html.
1. Copy and paste the repository files into the folder with the decompiled files. **replace** all files when prompted.
1. Run TweeGo to build the new html file.
