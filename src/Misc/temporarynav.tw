<tr><td width="15%">''Apparent Age:''</td><td colspan=3><<textbox "$PC.main.age" $PC.main.age>><<link " age note">><<replace "#agenote">><br>@@.note;Apparent age refers to the biological age of your new body, which has been changed from its original age via the accident. Your chronological, or true age, remains the same at <<print $PC.main.ageOriginal>>. Biological age determines appearance, and naturally varies from chronological age based on the individual. Biological age has been deemed definitively irrelevant to matters of consent and law by courts in the U.S. and most other countries (Including those in the E.U.). This is of course subject to the same exceptions for mental deficit and medical disorders whereby the individual is deemed unable to care for themselves, such as a situation of substituted consent for medical procedures in a hospital, or the ward and guardianship process whereby an individual, organization, or the state is appointed guardian of a disabled ward, typically a vulnerable adult. These exceptions do not apply in this case, as the player retains their full mental capacity. Setting a low age (25 or less) will typically result in incidents of being carded for purchasing alcohol and the like. Setting an age below 18 will have other impacts, such as suspecting a fake ID, being refused entry, and potential reduced attractiveness to NPCs. Setting a high age will have a corresponding impact to player fertility and attractiveness, starting with minor effects at 35 years of age.@@<br><</replace>><</link>><span id="agenote">.</span></td></tr>

You will find sex that ends in a creampie (whether accidental or intentional) to be more fullfilling. This doesn't include an urge to get pregnant, just a certain amount of risk, and you'll still want partners to pull out or use condom on risky days. This will not remove your worry about potential pregnancy or disease if applicable.<</replace>><</link>></td>

Unlike simply liking bare sex, you are far more likely to seek and engage in pregnancy-risk sex, and if the two are combined may even be willing to circumvent your partner's attempts at birth control to enjoy risky sex. You do not suffer worry about potential pregnancy, but can still become worried about disease if applicable. You tend to find large testicles more attractive.<</replace>><</link>></td>

You start high on the 'sex addiction' stat and gain it quicker, but also suffer less from humiliation and other negative social input.

<td width=25%><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.milk" false true >> <<link "Hypermilky">><<replace "#mutes">>''Hypermilky:'' This mutation causes your pituitary gland to constantly produce prolactin, meaning that you lactate all the time. It's like Prolactinoma, but without the brain tumor! If you get pregnant, you will end up producing a huge amount of milk. <i>This mutation affects breast size.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td width=20%><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.acid" false true >> <<link "Vaginal Enzymes">><<replace "#mutes">>''Vaginal Enzymes:'' Your Bartholin glands (two large-pea-sized glands that produce vaginal lubrication) secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your lubrication (including pre-intercourse activities), the greater the likelyhood that it will shred during intercourse or break upon ejaculation. <i>This mutation significatly affects condom effectiveness, but in a manageable way. Sex that finishes quickly without female orgasm has only a small chance of breakage, while long-duration sex will almost certainly result in the condom shredding.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td width=20%><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.birthCon" false true >> <<link "Abnormal Hormones">><<replace "#mutes">>''Abnormal Hormones:'' Your endocrine system is unusual, particularly in regard to gonadotropins, resulting in less effective chemical birth control. Birth control pills, patches, and implants have a much greater chance of being ineffective each cycle. <i>Increases odds from 2-4% to 15-30% depending on method. Failed birth control still requires impregnation & implantation check for pregnancy.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td width=20%><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.multiple" false true >> <<link "Multiple Ovulation">><<replace "#mutes">>''Multiple Ovulation:'' You have a very high chance to ovulate multiple eggs at once when you ovulate, allowing for fraternal twins, potentially with different fathers. <i>odds are determined by fertility.

<td><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.cycle" false true >> <<link "Hyper Ovulatory Phase">><<replace "#mutes">>''Hyper Ovulatory Phase:'' Your menstral cycle is tuned for fertility. You have an extended ovulatory phase during your menstral cycle that causes you to ovulate multiple times after your first ovulation. This causes your period to be especially brief, your highly-fertile period is greatly expanded, and you are more fertile than normal during the other portions of your cycle. <i>Combining this with Multiple Ovulation could result in some [[interesting|http://i.imgur.com/wD8sPmx.jpg]] results.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.twinWomb" false true >> <<link "Twin Wombs">><<replace "#mutes">>''Twin Wombs:'' You have two fully-formed and functional wombs, complete with two cervixes and two sets of ovaries. Your second womb is in the reversed anterior position. This allows you to have two pregnancies at once. <i>For right now, the second womb only becomes viable once the first is already pregnant. This could be changed depending on feedback.</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.phero" false true >> <<link "Vulva Pheromones">><<replace "#mutes">>''Vulva Pheromones:'' You secrete pheromones from your vulva that puts men into an animalistic rut. Men who have been exposed are unlikely to take no for an answer, even if they are normally considerate and respectful. This also includes considerations such as wearing a condom or pulling out. You will have to protect your groin until you are ready for sex.<</replace>><</link>></td>

You will not suffer intoxication, but also will not get any benefit from consuming alcohol. <i>Warning: you can still die from alcohol poisoning</i><</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.mouth" false true >> <<link "Salivary Enzymes">><<replace "#mutes">>''Salivary Enzymes:'' The salivary glands in your mouth secrete an extra enzyme called Rubber Oxygenase (RoxA) that allows cleavage and oxygenation of several rubber polymers including latex. Exposure to this enzyme rapidly degrades the structural integrity of condoms. The longer a condom is exposed to your mouth, the greater the likelyhood that it will fail.<</replace>><</link>></td>
<td><<checkbox "$PC.mutate.contort" false true >> <<link "Contortionist">><<replace "#mutes">>''Contortionist:'' You must have had circus performers in your ancestry.
