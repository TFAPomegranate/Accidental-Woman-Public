For women this is an athletic/lithe look, though because it emphasizes muscles the appearance changes dramatically with the amount of muscle mass. Interestingly enough, medical research has found this weight to be unhealthy in the long term, with higher mortality and incidence of disease. ''Value 4'' indicates a more natural amount of body fat. In males this amount of fat obscures muscle somewhat, making a clearly defined 'six-pack' difficult. In women this is the amount of fat needed for a smooth, curvy appearance, and is the most traditionally beautiful. Think soft, rather than pudgy, and you'll be on the right track.@@<</dialog>><</link>><br> ''Height''--Categories based on medical percentile data. <<link "More Info">><<dialog "Height Information">>@@.gab;Height information in Accidental Woman is based on statistical medical data for the United States. While using percentiles of height might not always match people's perception of what is 'very tall' or 'very short', it is more useful to base height standards on this information. This is because setting very tall and very short to higher and lower values respectively would result in very few NPCs fitting into that category, and making the preference generally useless. NPCs are generated with statistical distributions mirroring real life. Because of this, extreme values are rarely encountered.<br><br>Additionally, I am using the distribution for white people. This is because it is relatively average, and relates well to distributions in other countries. The African American distribution is actually very similar to the white distribution, in fact slightly shorter on average, but stretches much higher at the extreme tall end of the spectrum. (0.1 percentile). Anyways, please don't take this as a racist perspective. I may add support or patches for editing these values much later in development.@@<br><table><tr id="divide"><td colspan=3><h3>AW Height Ranges</h3></td></tr><tr><td width="20%">''Label''</td><td width="30%">''Height Range''</td><td>''Percentile Information''</td></tr><tr><td>Very Short</td><td>@@.note;below [5'6"/168cm (M)] [5'1"/155cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;95 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Short</td><td>@@.note;below [5'9"/174cm (M)] [5'3"/160cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;75 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>@@.note;below [6'/182cm (M)] [5'7"/170cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;50% of people fall in this range.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Tall</td><td>@@.note;below [6'3"/190cm (M)] [5'9"/175 cm(F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;20 percent of people fall in this range.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Very Tall</td><td>@@.note;this or more [6'3"/190cm (M)] [5'9"/175 cm(F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;5 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr></table><br><br><img src="http://halls.md/chart/MenHeightWhite2.gif"><</dialog>><</link>>@@

Both levels are within the healthy 'appropriate weight' range. ''Value 3''' indicates a low enough weight that muscle definition is easily visible, such as well-formed 'six-pack' abs. For women this is an athletic/lithe look, though because it emphasizes muscles the appearance changes dramatically with the amount of muscle mass. Interestingly enough, medical research has found this weight to be unhealthy in the long term, with higher mortality and incidence of disease. ''Value 4'' indicates a more natural amount of body fat. In males this amount of fat obscures muscle somewhat, making a clearly defined 'six-pack' difficult. In women this is the amount of fat needed for a smooth, curvy appearance, and is the most traditionally beautiful. Think soft, rather than pudgy, and you'll be on the right track.@@<</dialog>><</link>><br> ''Height''--Categories based on medical percentile data. <<link "More Info">><<dialog "Height Information">>@@.gab;Height information in Accidental Woman is based on statistical medical data for the United States. While using percentiles of height might not always match people's perception of what is 'very tall' or 'very short', it is more useful to base height standards on this information. This is because setting very tall and very short to higher and lower values respectively would result in very few NPCs fitting into that category, and making the preference generally useless. NPCs are generated with statistical distributions mirroring real life. Because of this, extreme values are rarely encountered.<br><br>Additionally, I am using the distribution for white people. This is because it is relatively average, and relates well to distributions in other countries. The African American distribution is actually very similar to the white distribution, in fact slightly shorter on average, but stretches much higher at the extreme tall end of the spectrum. (0.1 percentile). Anyways, please don't take this as a racist perspective. I may add support or patches for editing these values much later in development.@@<br><table><tr id="divide"><td colspan=3><h3>AW Height Ranges</h3></td></tr><tr><td width="20%">''Label''</td><td width="30%">''Height Range''</td><td>''Percentile Information''</td></tr><tr><td>Very Short</td><td>@@.note;below [5'6"/168cm (M)] [5'1"/155cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;95 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Short</td><td>@@.note;below [5'9"/174cm (M)] [5'3"/160cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;75 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>@@.note;below [6'/182cm (M)] [5'7"/170cm (F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;50% of people fall in this range.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Tall</td><td>@@.note;below [6'3"/190cm (M)] [5'9"/175 cm(F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;20 percent of people fall in this range.@@</td></tr><tr><td>Very Tall</td><td>@@.note;this or more [6'3"/190cm (M)] [5'9"/175 cm(F)]@@</td><td>@@.note;5 percent of people are taller than this.@@</td></tr></table><br><br><img src="http://halls.md/chart/MenHeightWhite2.gif"><</dialog>><</link>>@@
