</center>
<br>
@@.gab;You're probably going to find some parts of the upcoming story strange, and not in the usual way. Because the Prologue isn't finished yet, this strangeness won't exactly make sense. In fact, I've already fielded several questions about it. I'm going to leave this note in place at least until the Prologue is complete.@@
<br><br>
@@.gab;The player character just experienced a rather traumatic event, and is in the middle of trying to adjust to her new circumstances. The most obvious and least attractive thing to do here is just keep referencing the unease over and over. (ex "You still aren't used to your new body.") It gets old pretty quick, though it makes things pretty clear. A less common but more enjoyable approach is to try and display unease with everyday activities and events. (ex "You bump your hip on the doorframe, still adjusting to your new stature.") This is better, but also gets old. It also adds a bunch of writing that isn't entertaining; you normally wouldn't describe walking through a doorway!@@
<br><br>
@@.gab;I've decided to take a third approach with Accidental Woman, because the quality of the writing is really important to me. This is a text-based game, after all! I'm using a literary technique to deliberately cause confusion, before a minor catharsis from revealing the broader context. The specific technique I am using doesn't have a name (that I know of) but involves invoking cognitive dissonance in the reader. When we read fiction, we absorb the information we read to form our beliefs about the fictional world. I am deliberately providing information that sets up a strong opinion or belief about the player character, only to contradict it a short while later. The reader is stuck with contradictory information, which causes unease, discomfort, and confusion. How better to illustrate those same feelings in the player character?@@
<br><br>
@@.gab;Normally, this will cause an increase in curiosity, and the reader will pay more attention to figure out the "problem". This is useful for A) provoking a sense of wonder or curiosity about the fictional world, and B) making the tutorial learning period more interesting and effective. You can only keep this going for a limited duration though, because people will naturally jump to the conclusion that the storytelling is screwed up. (Usually picking out the specific element used for the technique.) If you provide resolution to the contradiction/s, however, it gives the reader a pleasurable feeling of satisfaction at having 'figured out' what was going on... catharsis.@@
<br><br>
@@.gab;I'm primarily using the player character's sexuality, with a few other minor elements, to create this effect. It has the benefit of being both important and indistinct. Constantly changing the color of a detail like the color of the pc's car doesn't work, because it isn't important enough. Changing a distinct detail with no room for confusion also doesn't work, because it's too obvious (dramatically shortening available time) and hard to reconcile later.@@
<br><br>
@@.gab;Thanks for putting up with this unfinished technique, and putting up with this long explaination. Rest assured that the pc's sexuality is entirely up you.@@

@@.head3;W@@ith the hectic events of the day now over, but many more to come in the following days, you find yourself in a temporary quiet lull. Standing exhausted in Lily's spare bedroom, but wondering how you'll be able to sleep with all the thoughts rushing through your head. The most disconcerting thought of all is how your very mind seems to have changed along with your body. To make matters worse, you aren't even angry or upset in anything more than an abstract way; it's more like being upset because you know you <i>should</i> be. It all seems terribly--even horrifically--natural, after that brief moment of shock when you awoke, you've been hard pressed to feel like anything was <i>wrong</i>. Not a trace or hint of feeling trapped in a woman's body, nothing to make you feel out of place.
<br><br>
@@.head3;I@@f it wasn't for the fact that you knew your brain had been altered too, you might even say that you belonged in this body all along. You feel  curious about yourself of course, but overall you feel fine... <i>excited</i> even. As your mind starts to happily wander through different possibilities for your new life, you are inevitably brought short by the sense--perhaps guilt--that you shouldn't be so okay with all this.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Y@@ou're wearing some baggy pajamas you borrowed from Lily, but you've never been comfortable sleeping in a whole bunch of clothes. Unfortunately, with your <<pcCupSize>> breasts and <<pcHipSize>> hips, Lily's bras or panties wouldn't be a good fit for you. So it seems like you'll be sleeping in the nude tonight. Buying clothes is just one of the things you have to do in the next few days. You unbutton the large childish buttons of the pajama shirt, removing it and tossing it onto a dresser. You bend over and pull down the loose pants, quickly removing your legs one at a time. You're about to toss them onto the dresser when you're stopped short by the realization that you did all that completely naturally. You're a new height with different hips and legs, not to mention your new breasts and a different center of gravity... and you didn't so much as wobble. You distractedly toss the pants, not even looking to see where they landed, and walk over to the antique-looking dressing mirror in the corner of the room.
<br><br>
@@.head3;Y@@ou stand <<measurement "height">> tall, with smooth and soft $PC.skinColor skin. You have your hair tied back in a simple ponytail, but its $groom.hairColor luster still makes it seem luxurious somehow.<<if $groom.pubeStyle isnot "hairless">> Looking at your shaved armpits and $groom.pubeStyle <<if $groom.pubeStyle == "neat patch" || $groom.pubeStyle == "landing strip">>of <</if>>$groom.pubeColor pubic hair, you realize that Lily must have done some cleaning up for you while you slept those few days.<</if>> You suddenly remember that Lily is into women, but that fact doesn't seem to be all that exciting. With your lifetime of experience as a man, you know that the idea of some lesbian action with a hot girl like Lily should be getting you worked up... but it isn't. <<if $trait.libido > 4>>You'd still like to lick every part of her, but it feels different somehow. <<elseif $trait.libido > 2>>You'd still be glad to take her to bed, but it feels different somehow. <</if>>

@@.head3;W@@hen you try to imagine something sexy, your mind immediately brings up <i>male</i> images on its own. It's like your subconscious had already connected the dots and realized you like men more than women now. Your helpful subconscious dredges up an old memory from the locker room in your senior year of high school. Todd was an insufferable ass, but he certainly had the <i>equipment</i> to back up his confidence. He popped an erection in the locker room after PE, but rather than teasing or any blatant insults, everyone was just stunned by the size of his cock. A Pringles can would be an apt comparison. You realize that at some point in your reverie you had started licking your lips, and your hand had drifted upward to start squeezing one of your <<pcBoobSize>> <<pcTitShape>> breasts. Your <<pcNipple>> nipples are hard and waiting,<<if $mutate.Milk>> unexpected beading with creamy milk,<</if>> and you shake your head to help clear your thoughts.
<br><br>
 @@.head3;Y@@ou focus on your face in the mirror, which <<pcFaceDescript>>. You have clear but tired-looking $PC.eyeColor eyes, and a certain flush in your cheeks thanks to your growing arousal. You take your time to examine every detail of your <<pcWeight>> <<pcTone>> body. You have <<pcShoulderSize>> shoulders, with a <<pcWaist>> waist leading down to <<pcHipSize>> hips and a <<pcAssSize>> ass. On your chest rests <<pcChest>> that could be described as <<pcTitShape>>.

 <<if $PC.wetness > 3>>
 You know you are normally ridiculously wet, saying you are ready all the time is likely an understatement. It might actually be noticeable in public if you aren't careful, something you'll have to look out for. Your present state of arousal has
