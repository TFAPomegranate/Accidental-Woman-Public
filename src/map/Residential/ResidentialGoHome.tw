:: ResidentialGoHome [nobr]

@@.typewriter;.white;Welcome to the normally-invisible passage that will forward you on to the correct player home.

Definitely something bad. Probably rape. (<i>Or a world with zero rape, if rape is the type of thing that sounds good to you. I'm looking at ''you'' Shalltear. </i>;)@@
